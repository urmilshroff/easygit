# EasyGit

A straight-forward, no-brainer way to use Git from the Terminal without having to remember any of those complicated commands.

## Note

The commits in this repository are quite messed up, because I test and debug in the `master` branch which basically screws with itself.

## Installing

To install the script, run the following command in the macOS or Linux Terminal:

```
bash install.sh
```
